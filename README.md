# ISEF Exam Project

By MBUNGANU Lewiston MEBONGHO

# How the program works

It is a simple program for student record management. With it, you can

- Add a new student
- See a list of students added within the current log in session
- Search a student added within the current session by student id
- Save currently added students to a file on the desktop
- Load a list of students from a file provided by the user on the desktop.

# Challenges faced

- Obtaining more than just a single student name.
- Unable to load previously save student data when displaying all students (can be worked around by combining the saveRecords and loadRecords functions)
